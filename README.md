# Past Projects:

- [Time Tracking App](https://github.com/sosaedison/AppTracker)
: AppTracker was a project I built at my [Voxel VR](https://www.voxelvrp.com/) internship. This application was used to collect data about the games that customers played so that we can use it for invoicing as well as marketing new experiences.
- [Senior Capstone React App](https://github.com/auto-garcon/webui)
: The Auto Garcon web application was built during my Senior Capstone class, Spring of 2020. Its purpose was to manage ticket service and menus for restaurants.
- [Intro Web Dev class weather app](https://github.com/sosaedison/RebeccaSosawebapp)
: The weather application linked here was one of the first ever projects I co-wrote in my web dev class. No framework just vanilla javascript, html and css.
